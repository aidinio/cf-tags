# cf-tags
A simple script to visualize the count of different tags in codeforces problems.
# Usage
Just run the main.py! The program will try to download the data through the Codeforces API then store it in a file. If you want to get the new data, just delete the file which the problems get written to (default is problems_file). Then enter the problem rating and minimum cotestId separated with a space.
# Sample outputs
Output of `800 1000`:
